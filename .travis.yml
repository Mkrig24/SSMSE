# R for travis: see documentation at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r
# This runs old, current, and dev release of r on linux, but only current
# release of r on osx. This decision was because the packages that travis tried
# to download while testing out the osx build with dev version of r were not
# available at the url. The erroring of this build had nothing to do with the 
# SSMSE R package.
