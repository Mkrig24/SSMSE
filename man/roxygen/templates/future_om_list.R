#' @param future_om_list An optional list of lists including changes that should
#'  be made after the end year of the input model. Each first level list element
#'  outlines 1 change to be made to the operating model. To see an example, try
#'  running \code{\link{create_future_om_list}}. Defaults to NULL, which implies
#'  that the model will be extended forward in time assuming the original model
#'  structure.
