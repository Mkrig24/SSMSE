Description: An R package for performing Management Strategy Evaluation
    (MSE) using Stock Synthesis (SS). SS is used as the Operating Model (OM) 
    and, if the user desires, the Estimation model (EM). SSMSE allows existing 
    SS models to be used as the basis for an OM. These OMs are used in the MSE 
    framework provided by SSMSE to evaluate the implications of management 
    actions on a population given uncertainty.
